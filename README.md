# ConvolutionExample

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate a convolution implementation in python which will be enhanced with a fourier transform. 
I will be providing a jupyter notebook with in-depth documentation along with a raw python file.
The implementation will provide one with an already included library along with a from-scratch implementation.
The from-scratch implementation will use libraries, but only those that will help with the overall performance of the program, i.e Numpy.
